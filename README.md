# Facial-Emotion-Recognition

Built training my own model and saving the model weights in the model.h5 file. the testlive.py opens a live feed to run the recognition system while the teststatic.py applies the system on a photo (persong.jpg in this case). The accuracy of this model is 53% and is trained by 50 epochs
The main.py is the code for training the model, using the FER-2013 dataset
